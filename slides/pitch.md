# Coffee-POS
## Point-of-Sale for Independent Coffee Shops

**Stack:** React + TypeScript + Supabase + Tailwind CSS
**Theme:** Espresso & Copper
**PechaKucha 6×20** — 6 slides, 20 seconds each

---

# The Problem

## Small café owners lose time & money every shift.

- **Slow checkouts** — scribbled orders, mental math, shared tills
- **Messy inventory** — no real-time stock tracking, surprise shortages mid-rush
- **Zero customer memory** — regulars' preferences live in baristas' heads
- **Paper receipts** — lost, faded, useless for end-of-month reconciliation

**Result:** long queues, wasted beans, missed repeat business.

# The User

## Independent café owners & their baristas.

| Who | Needs |
|---|---|
| **Owner** | Track sales, manage stock, view reports |
| **Barista** | Fast order entry, split payments, weight-based pricing |
| **Both** | Works on counter tablet — touch-first, not mouse-first |

Role-based access: `admin` → `manager` → `cashier`
Cashiers see only the POS terminal. No distractions.

# Solution Sketch

## Coffee-POS: fast, warm, built for the counter.

- **Touch-friendly UI** — `.touch-friendly` mode with larger tap targets, no tiny dropdowns
- **Espresso & Copper theme** — warm browns (`#9a693a` / `#7a4f2c`), `Fraunces` headings, `DM Sans` body
- **Real-time cart** — weight-based products, automatic discount checks, split payments
- **Multi-currency** — MMK and LKR support via `CurrencyContext`
- **Sales tabs** — user-scoped, pick up where you left off
- **Role-gated navigation** — baristas stay in POS, owners access reports + settings
